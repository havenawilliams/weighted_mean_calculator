#Weighed Mean Calculator

Dr. Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, a political scientist known for forecasting the outcomes of political events, developed a very simple method for predicting the outcome of an event. While Bueno de Mesquita is better known for his Predictioneer's Game, a highly complex modelling software that uses game theory to predict the outcome of political events, a much simpler method also appears frequently throughout his literature. It is the Weighted Mean Calculator. The weighted mean calculator works like this: the position, capabilities, and salience of each actor in a system are multiplied and summed in the numerator, and the denominator is the capabilities and salience of each actor in that system and summed in the denominator. The outcome is a policy position weighted by the capabilities and salience of all actors. It is very simple and the script included in this repository is a demonstration of this program. Bueno de Mesquita reports this measure is 70% accurate in predicting the outcome of a political event, and is more accurate when applied to non-coercive settings, especially democratic voting processes. I leave it here for your consideration.
